# Project Documentation

## Overview
This project is a React application created using Create React App (CRA). It features a simple UI that allows users to input a color name, which then changes the background color of a displayed element. Additionally, users can toggle the text color between black and white to ensure contrast with the background color.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory. You will need Node.js and npm installed on your machine.

## Installation
1. Install dependencies:
   npm install
   
2. Start the development server:
   npm start
   
This runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
   
### Available Scripts
- `npm start`: Starts the development server.
- `npm test`: Runs tests in interactive watch mode.
- `npm run build`: Builds the app for production.
- `npm run eject`: Removes the single build dependency from your project.

## Project Structure
- `public/index.html`: The HTML template.
- `src/index.jsx`: The entry point for React.
- `src/App.jsx`: Contains the main application logic and UI.
- `src/index.css`: Contains CSS for the application.

## Key Components
### App Component
The `App` component (`src/App.jsx`) is the main component of the application. It manages the state for the color input and text color toggle. It renders a color display area and a form for inputting a color and toggling the text color.

### SetColor Component
The `SetColor` component is a child of the `App` component and is responsible for rendering the input field and toggle button. It handles the change events for both the input field and the toggle button.

## Deployment
To deploy the application, you can run:
npm run build

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. For more information on deployment, refer to the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the Create React App documentation.
